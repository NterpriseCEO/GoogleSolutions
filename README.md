# Foodify GDSC Solution Challenge 2021

## Our Solution
Our solution to the problem: to develop an app that allows users to quickly scan food items through the camera of their smartphone and store relevant details along with their expiry date. 
After doing this the app will organise the food in their fridge into different categories, which are searchable, and send push notifications before the food goes off. Along with this we also show users a timeline of when their food is expiring. Hence, allowing them to plan meals ahead of using those ingredients. These features make the user continuously aware of the state of their fridge and pantry, promoting sustainable consumption of food and severely reducing wastage.
